# circle-shooter
<h2> A colorful shooting game - having fun with p5.js </h2>
For now, the game allows you to simply shoot a small, independently moving circle at a large, minimally orbiting circle. The fired circles are of a random color and color the large circle, which increases the hit counter.
You can also activate the mode of clearing the board of fired circles. <br> <br>

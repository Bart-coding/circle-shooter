### A colorful shooting game - having fun with p5.js</br>
![obraz](https://github.com/Bart-coding/circle-shooter/assets/74357483/38e1a081-785e-4916-859c-f299af497270)

For now, the game allows you to simply shoot a small, independently moving circle at a large, minimally orbiting circle. The fired circles are of a random color and color the large circle, which increases the hit counter.
You can also:
* activate the clean mode to clear the board of fired circles
* change volume of sound effects: left/right arrow key to volume down/up and "M" key to mute/unmute volume.

To play the game, you will probably have to use [a local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

Kudos are due to the creators of the sound effects who posted them on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com).
